# COMP 5970 Final Project
In this project we (Connor Morris, Ashleigh Payne, and Henry Roden) created a web application that takes gesture inputs from the browsers webcam and uses a convolutional neural network to preform a given Spotify task, namely: pause, play, skip to next, and skip to previous.

# Running this code
If you want to run this code you must have node.js installed. Then navigate to the directory where this is stored and run spotify.js with
`node spotify.js`
From here on your browser go to localhost:8888/login to get logged in on Spotify.
When ever you are ready you can start playing music on the device you wish to control and click the 'Capture Gesture' button.

Now all you have to do is move your hands and you will be changing songs in no time!
